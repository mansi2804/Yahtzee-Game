## Summary and Reflection

In my implementation, I focused on creating a seamless user experience while maintaining a clean separation between the UI and game logic. I paid close attention to responsiveness, ensuring the app adapts well across different platforms like macOS and Chrome. The use of custom UI elements, such as animated progress bars, dynamic button designs, and subtle shadows, added a layer of visual polish that enhances the overall user experience. 

I thoroughly enjoyed the challenge of combining functionality with design. Creating visually appealing animations and experimenting with responsive layouts was particularly rewarding. The most difficult part was fine-tuning the dynamic layout to prevent overflow issues while keeping the interface smooth and intuitive. It was a great learning experience. Overall, this MP gave me a deeper appreciation for handling dynamic states in Flutter applications.
